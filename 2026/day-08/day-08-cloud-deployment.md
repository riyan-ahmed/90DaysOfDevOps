# Deploy a Real Web Server on the Cloud

Step 1 : Launch an instance from AWS console.

Step 2 : Connect to instance using ssh.
    
Command : `ssh -i "linux-for-devops.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-94-214-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com`

Step 3 : Install Nginx

Command : `sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install nginx`
        
Step 3 : Configure security groups for web access.
    From the AWS console, go to the security group and add an inbound rule for port 80 (default for Nginx).
    
Step 4 : Check logs of nginx service

Command : `journalctl -u nginx`

Step 5 : Save logs to file

Commad : `scp -i "linux-for-devops.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-94-214-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/var/log/nginx/access.log .`
    
`scp -i "linux-for-devops.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-94-214-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/journalctl.log .`
    
## Install Docker

Command `sudo apt install docker.io`
    
# Challenges Faced

* Unable to access Nginx using the public IP.

 Solution: I had forgotten to add port 80 to the security group inbound rules. Once added, Nginx became accessible.

* My custom HTML page was not loading on the webpage.

 Solution: I reloaded the Nginx service. After reloading, my aboutme.html page was accessible.

* File permissions issue when accessing logs.

 Solution : Needed sudo to read /var/log/nginx/access.log.


# What I Learned

* Connect to an AWS cloud instance using SSH.

* How to manage security group (adding inbound rules)

* How to install Nginx and serve a webpage.

* The importance of reloading a service after configuration changes or adding new files.

* How to transfer files securely from the instance to the local machine using scp.

* Confusion between journalctl and access logs. Learned that journalctl -u nginx shows service logs, while HTTP requests are recorded in /var/log/nginx/access.log.
